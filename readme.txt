Redefining your editorial workflow.

== Description ==

Edit Flow empowers you to collaborate with your editorial team inside WordPress. We've made it modular so you can customize it to your needs:

* [Calendar](http://editflow.org/features/calendar/) - A convenient month-by-month look at your content.
* [Custom Statuses](http://editflow.org/features/custom-statuses/) - Define the key stages to your workflow.
* [Editorial Comments](http://editflow.org/features/editorial-comments/) - Threaded commenting in the admin for private discussion between writers and editors.
* [Editorial Metadata](http://editflow.org/features/editorial-metadata/) - Keep track of the important details.
* [Notifications](http://editflow.org/features/notifications/) - Receive timely updates on the content you're following.
* [Story Budget](http://editflow.org/features/story-budget/) - View your upcoming content budget.
* [User Groups](http://editflow.org/features/user-groups/) - Keep your users organized by department or function.

More details for each feature, screenshots and documentation can be found on [our website](http://editflow.org/).

We'd love to hear from you! For support questions, feedback and ideas, please use the [WordPress.org forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/edit-flow?forum_id=10), which we look at often. If you'd like to contribute code, [we'd love to have you involved](http://editflow.org/contribute/).

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install this plugin is to go to Add New in the Plugins section of your blog admin and search for "Edit Flow." On the far right side of the search results, click "Install."

If the automatic process above fails, follow these simple steps to do a manual install:

1. Extract the contents of the zip file into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Write and enjoy the merits of a structured editorial workflow!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Edit Flow work with multisite? =

Yep, in the sense that you can activate Edit Flow on each subsite. Edit Flow doesn't yet offer the ability to manage content across a network of sites.

= Edit Flow doesn't do X, Y, and Z. That makes me sad. =

All development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/Edit-Flow).

For support questions, feedback and ideas, please use the [WordPress.org forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/edit-flow?forum_id=10), which we look at often. For everything else, say [hello@editflow.org](mailto:hello@editflow.org).

== Screenshots ==

1. The calendar is a convenient month-by-month look at your content. Filter to specific statuses or categories to drill down.
2. Custom statuses allow you to define the key stages of your workflow.
3. Editorial comments allow for private discussion between writers and editors on a post-by-post basis.
4. Keep track of the important details with editorial metadata.

* Bug fix: Use the proper singlular label for a post type when generating notification text
* Bug fix: Post slug now updates when the post has a custom status.
* Bug fix: When determining whether a user can change a post's status, check the 'edit_posts' cap for the post type.

= 0.7.3 (Jul. 3, 2012) =
* Bug fix: Support PHP 5.2.x by removing the anonymous functions we mistakenly added

= 0.7.1 (Apr. 11, 2012) =

* Allow users to save post subscriptions the first time they save the post. This also fixes the bug where a user wouldn't be subscribed until they saved the post twice

* Bug fix: Auto-subscribe the post author to their posts by default but make it filterable
* Bug fix: Only show authors in the user dropdown for the calendar and the story budget. This new behavior can be filtered out however

* Bug fix: Prevent editorial metadata filters from stomping on others' uses by actually returning the original value when we don't want to manipulate it
* Bug fix: Specify a max-width on `<select>` dropdowns in the calendar and story budget so long values don't break formatting

= 0.7 (Jan. 9, 2012) =
* Entire plugin was rewritten into a modular architecture (e.g. each feature is broken into a module you can enable or disable). One point of the modular architecture is to make it much easier for others to contribute new features. For the end user, there’s a brand new settings page where you can manage your modules. Each module then registers a configuration view for module settings. Most have options to choose which post types you’d like it activated for, along with other configuration options.
* Calendar is far more functional. Content is viewed in a six week view by default, and number of weeks is configurable in screen options. Posts can be dragged and dropped between dates. Click on a post title to get the details about the post, including editorial metadata.
* Custom statuses can be drag and drop ordered with AJAX. All statuses (including core ‘draft’ and ‘pending’) can be edited or deleted.
* Editorial Metadata terms can be ordered with AJAX. Terms can be made “viewable” and then will be displayed on the manage posts view and calendar if enabled.
* Story Budget shows “viewable” editorial metadata and fixes a few bugs, including not showing posts in a subcategory of a parent category.
* Notifications/subscriptions are filtered so you can disable the auto-subscribing of authors or editorial commenters.
* Important note: If upgrading from pre-v0.6, please upgrade to v0.6.5 first to ensure all of your data remains intact.
* [Read the full release post](http://editflow.org/2012/01/09/edit-flow-v0-7-modular-architecture-monthly-calendar-and-sortable-statuses/)

= 0.6.5 (Sept. 19, 2011) =
* Bug fix: Workaround for a bug in core where the timestamp is set when a post is saved with a custom status. Instead, we update the timestamp on publish to current time if a custom post date hasn't been set. Thanks saomay for [help tracking the bug down](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-edit-flow-custom-statuses-create-timestamp-problem/).

* Display unpublished custom statuses inline with the post title, per WordPress standard UI
* New number type for editorial metadata, so you can have fields like "Word Count"

= 0.6 (Nov. 9, 2010) =

We've expanded this functionality to be completely customizable; admins can add any number of editorial metadata with the following types: checkbox, date, location, paragraph, text, or user dropdown.
* New feature: Story Budget. View all of your upcoming posts in a more traditional story budget view. Posts are grouped by category, and view can be filtered by post status, category, user, or limited to a date range. Hit the print button to take it on the go.
* Completely rewritten calendar view now saves filter state on a user by user basis. Also, highlights current day, and displays status and time for each post.
* Temporarily disabled QuickPitch widget until we rewrite it to support editorial metadata.
* Bug fix: Editorial comments should no longer show up in the stock Recent Comments widget or in the comments view in the WordPress Admin. The comment count number should also be correct.
* Bug fix: Duplicate custom post statuses and usergroups are handled in more sane ways (aka creating, editing, and deleting should work as expected)

= 0.5.3 (Oct. 6, 2010) =
* Fixes issue where default Custom Statuses and User Groups were returning even after being deleted

= 0.5.1 (Jul. 29, 2010) =
